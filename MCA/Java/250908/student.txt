Java Program using Constructors & Methods.
===========================================
Create a class Student with the instance variables name, rollNumber, and course to store data for each Student object. 
The class should have a parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variables with values passed during object creation. 
The class should also have a default constructor to create a Student object without providing initial values and setting default values for the instance variables. 
Define a method displayStudentDetails() which prints the details of a Student object to the console. 
The class should also contain an updateCourse(String course) method which modifies the course instance variable of a Student object. 

Write down a java program to perform the above operations using the Student object. 
The values for the parameterized constructor should accept from the user.
