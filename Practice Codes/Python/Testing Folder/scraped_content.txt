Let's talk. How to clear the screen in Java In order to clean the screen in Java, there are three methods that are the most used by expert developers in this language: Using the ANSI escape code Using the platform-specific command Using the command-line interpreter 1. Using the ANSI escape code This ANSI escape sequence can be defined as standard in-band signaling to control cursor position. In this tutorial, the escape code \033[H\033[2J will be used. Explained separately: \033: Represents the ASCII escape character. Its ANSI value is 27. It means ESC.
[: Represents the escape sequence. Combining the above codes, we get \033[ or ESC[. public class ClearScreenExample1
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J");
System.out.flush();
}
} 2. Using the platform-specific command Another popular method to clean the console in Java is the command offered by the platform we are using. To do this, you first get the system property using getProperty() of the System class. Then the command used on the platform to clear the console is selected. System.getProperty() method This method is used to get the system property indicated by the specified key. In syntax it looks like this: public static String getProperty(String key) Now let's create a program to clean up the console in Java using the platform-specific command: public class ClearScreenExample2
{
public final static void clearConsole()
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
try
{
final String os = System.getProperty("os.name");
if (os.contains("Windows"))
{
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cls");
}
}
catch (final Exception e)
{
e.printStackTrace();
}
} More about features that the best Java development company must have. Let's work together. 3. Using the command line interpreter With this method, the command line interpreter, CMD for its acronym in English, is invoked. After doing this, the interpreter executes the cls command. It can be done using the heritageIO() method. import java.io.IOException;
public class ClearScreenExample3
{
public static void main(String... arg) throws IOException, InterruptedException
{
new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls").inheritIO().start().waitFor();
}
} Thus, with these three simple methods, the developer will be able to clean the console in Java.
