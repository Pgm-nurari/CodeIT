|----------> File: 00mongo.py <----------|
    The code in this file looks good right? But, it is not. The statement to fetch the database names:
    
        con = checkConnection()
        print(con.list_database_names())
    
    will give us an error: pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError
    
    That means the connection is not made with MongoDB server. But, when the code is run we are not notified whether the connection made is a
    success or not. The statement : 

        c = MongoClient(host=host_name, port=port_num)

    accepts hostname and portnumber passed into the argument. But the hostname passed is "loca" and not "localhost". Hence the connection will
    not be successful at all. But we were not notified of it. That is because MongoClient does "lazy connection" ie. it does not actually
    connect to MongoDB when we instantiate it. So inorder to connect, we must use the below command to check if it has connected or not:
        
        c.admin.command("ping")

    Which forces the MongoClient to establish the connection first.

    You can check the corrected and better code in 2nd function : checkConnectionSecond()
